        <h3>Pitch & Keypoints</h3>
        <p class="detail-description">
          During the Golden Age of piracy, raids against the coastal cities and naval battles became more and more 
          frequent. In this harsh world, the call of freedom, glory, and richness took you far from your birthplace. 
          Life at sea, friendship with your crew, tight navigation, merciless battles, invaluable treasures … that’s 
          what awaits you in your adventure! But will you become a loved or hated captain? A skilful assassin or a 
          mighty fighter? Will you drive a fast and untouchable ship or a vessel so powerful and impressive an entire 
          fleet would flee? The choices are yours! Take your future in hand and build your legend!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Historical / Fiction (Golden Age of Piracy in the Caribbean)</li>
          <li>- 350 paragraphs of non-linear story</li>
          <li>- Multiple branching</li>
          <li>- Original rules</li>
          <li>- Software: Twine</li>
          <li>- Language: English</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Basic rules</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Freedom at Sea</em> is the first volume of the <em>Pirate’s Life</em> collection of Build Your Own Adventure Books.
        </p>
        <p>
          It follows the usual rules of its genre and lets the player <em>choose the next action</em> at the end of each chapter. 
          Because of that, the reader crafts his/her own story.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this first book is a prequel where the player builds his/her character. Meaning that the actions 
          are taken to <em>improve the characteristics</em> and the chosen abilities of the young pirate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many other factors must be taken into consideration, as the composition of the crew, the choice of the ship, 
          the management of the money and resources, and much more.
        </p>
        <h3>Structure</h3>

        <h3>Sample (chapter 1)</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 1:</h4>
        <p>
          You are awakened in the middle of the night by loud cracks and flashing lights coming from the outside. 
          Looking through the window, you notice that the city is on fire! People are running in every direction, 
          screaming and fleeing to the city centre. Some buildings had started to collapse, their frontages falling 
          into pieces on the ground, causing panic reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You scan the streets, trying to locate the reason for those disturbances. Suddenly, you catch sight on 
          an enormous black ship, wearing blood-red sails, with fog surrounding it, coming from its sixty fuming 
          canons. You recognise the intruders at once, they are pirates! The crew counts at least 300 merciless 
          raiders, eager for treasures and violence. The vessel is vomiting the burglars in waves, overwhelming 
          the local guards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those robbers had already visited the houses and shops from the quay and the east part of the city. You 
          are surprised by so much cruelty, pirates are usually very quick and don’t look for direct flights. Yet, 
          those appear to enjoy slaying and frightening the innocents.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can only make out the shape of their captain, a huge figure, twice the size of an average man. He 
          gives deadly orders, with calm, serenity and an obvious firm hand. The picture is so unreal you even 
          doubt his actual existence for a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your attention focuses on the stampede once again, and you realise you must move to stay alive, as a 
          group of thieves is moving towards your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will you help the soldiers to repel the attackers? Go to <em>82</em>. Or will you take refuge in the town centre 
          with the other citizens? Go to <em>363</em>.
