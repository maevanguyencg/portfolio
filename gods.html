        <h3>Pitch & Keypoints</h3>
        <p class="detail-description">
          Enter the Fantasy universe of Mekure, a young planet just built by the gods who are still living there, helping, 
          guiding and sometimes controlling their creations. That means you! Some people accept that fact and prey actively 
          the immortals while others, who value freedom above all, rebel without compromise! You progress in a thriving world 
          marked by that ever-present conflict where the makers and the population try to get along with one another. But 
          as the tension grows, it’s more and more obvious that you’re in a turning point of history!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Fantasy / Antiquity </li>
          <li>- Mix of Pen-and-Paper RPG, video RPG and board game</li>
          <li>- Creation of the whole original universe</li>
          <li>- Creation of multiple campaigns, quests, adventures</li>
          <li>- Creation of the rulebook for 1 to a group of players</li>
          <li>- Creation of side elements as an e-mag, a marketing campaign, a website, etc.</li>
          <li>- Language: English</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Description (project)</h3>
        <p>
          The game is a part of a <em>transmedia</em> with a story that can be enhanced by the community. The main universe, 
          history, NPC, races, resources, context, etc. are provided but let a <em>huge room for creativity</em> and customisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <em>e-mag</em> would be released each month with news, additional campaigns and quests, guides, mini-games, ….
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the other supports are board games, books, escape games, short novels, comics, card games and gamebooks.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic rules</h3>
        <p>
          In God’s Playground, you have many different ways to play, based on your preferences and whether you are alone or in a group.
        </p>
        <p>
          You build your character as in a PnP-RPG and start the adventure with it. At this moment, you are free to explore the 
          world, complete the quests, craft, kill monster or enemies, build cities, sell goods, take part of a guild and so on. 
          Each action you take evolves your character and makes it unique!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you play alone, you could use the <em>board</em> to get your bearings and use the <em>quest book</em> to go forward. If you are in a group with a 
          game master, your experience is closer to a usual PnP-RPG but it can be enhanced with <em>multiple side materials</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is like a video RPG but played on paper and board!
        </p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>
          Mekure is a young planet <em>newly created by the Gods</em> who have already built the main parts of the world as well as numerous 
          creatures who learn to live together. But their task is not finished yet, and they continue their improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the divinities, their creation reflects their <em>social status</em> and <em>pride</em>. So they rule Mekure as sole leaders 
          and expect the population to obey without asking questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some people start to rebel and desire freedom above all. By defying the Masters, they threat the natural balance of 
          the planet. However, the consequences are not the ones expected...
