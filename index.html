      <h2>Narrative Designer</h2>
      <p class="pitch">
        I am a video games lover passionate about creating fun and believable stories. 
        After working as a Freelance Game Artist and as a Web Developer, I am currently 
        designing my own games, focusing on interactive adventures and polished game designs. 
        I'd love to combine my passion for storytelling with my sensibility for the player 
        and my rigor to contribute to build addictive and entertaining games!

        <h3>Freedom at sea</h3>
        <p class="project-description">
          During the Golden Age of piracy, raids against the coastal cities and naval battles 
          became more and more frequent. In this harsh world, the call of freedom, glory and 
          richness took you far from your birthplace. 
          Life at sea, friendship with your crew, tight navigation, merciless battles, invaluable 
          treasures... that's what awaits you in your adventure! But will you become a loved or 
          hated captain? A skilfull assassin or a mighty fighter? Will you drive a fast and 
          untouchable ship or a vessel so powerful and impressive an entire fleet would flee? 
          The choices are yours! Take your future in hand and build your own legend!
