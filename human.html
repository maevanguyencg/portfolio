        <h3>Pitch & Keypoints</h3>
        <p class="detail-description">
          The enchanted world is dying. Elves, Orcs, Werewolves, Dwarves and other magical creatures are losing their powers 
          and nothing seems to be of any help. But in this tragedy, a soul is born, the first human. You incarnate this precursor, 
          eager to live and to find your place among the older races. Travel all over the world, meet extraordinary people, 
          fight against your worse nightmares, learn the secrets of your past and train for your future! A whole civilization 
          awaits to be built!

        <h3>Description (project)</h3>
        <p>
          First Human is an <em>interactive video game</em> where all of your choices matter for the story and your 
          progression. You play the first representative of humanity who must build the entire civilization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is a mix between an RPG and an STR where you must both master your character and plan 
          for the future of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          During your adventure, you will meet other species and you should strengthen your relationships 
          with them, learn how to survive in various biomes, build shelters and tools, hunt, but also fight 
          to stay alive, conquest strategic places and protect your fellow souls.
        </p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>
          The game starts in a <em>Fantasy universe</em> populated with enchanted creatures as elves, werewolves, 
          orcs, centaurs, dwarves and so on. But the wells of magic are emptying and the supernatural 
          beings get <em>weaker and weaker</em>. In this context, some babies born powerless and with different 
          physical shapes. It is your case, as a <em>human</em> born among the elves. You are rejected by your tribe 
          and seen as an abnormality. But you soon discover that you are a perfect fit for this new 
          <em>magicless world</em>.
