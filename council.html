        <h3>Pitch & Keypoints</h3>
        <p class="detail-description">
          2204: our world is devastated after an unprecedented economic and sanitary crisis. The current government just 
          seized control forcefully and is enslaving the population. Former guard of those rulers, you’re now an investigator 
          working for the rebellion. With your heavy address book, your maps of sensitive places, your computer, your full 
          access to all types of news and your research capacities, resolve the enquiries that awaits you to dismantle the 
          politic power! Will you be able to free the people from tyranny? Can you find out why you were fired? Can you steal 
          the needed information to help the rebels? Will you risk your life to recruit new agents? Start your mission now!

        <h3>Description (project)</h3>
        <p>
          <em>The Council: Expected Freedom</em> is an investigation and deduction game where you incarnate Evans, a <em>detective</em> working with the 
          rebellion whose goal is to <em>dismantle the politic power</em> in place. As you worked with those politicians before, you have access 
          to many <em>useful resources</em> as an address book, some informers, multiple maps, access to their internal IT system, or badges and 
          cards to lead your inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is divided into <em>10 main missions</em> that follow each other and reveal the story step by step. And also multiple 
          <em>side quests</em> to earn achievements and additional knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each mission starts with a brief to set the context and guide you to start your researches. It is then up to you to choose 
          the best approach to resolve each case as they all can be <em>solved in multiple ways</em>. But be careful, if you take too many risks, 
          you could be trapped, captured, or even killed!
        </p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>
          Our world was ravaged by a <em>health crisis</em> caused by a virulent and highly contagious virus. 
          As mankind was decimated, the human activity was drastically reduced and everybody focused 
          on finding a vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
          After many months of research and coordinate effort, a cure was found and people tried to go 
          back to a <em>normal life</em>. But the <em>economic crisis</em> that followed was too important for it. Every 
          political answer failed to restore peace and hope, and the population started to panic and 
          rebel. In this chaotic atmosphere, a young and ambitious man named Alan took the <em>power by 
          force</em> and convinced the powerful individuals of the world to support him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In only a few weeks, he became the new leader of the entire world, and in several months he 
          <em>imposed his tyranny</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, humanity is divided into two, the <em>riches and powerful</em> in one side, and the <em>poor and 
          weak</em> in the other. The firsts get everything by enslaving the seconds who work hard and 
          barely survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>rebellion</em> grows in the population, and it is now time to restore equality and to turn the tables!
        </p>
