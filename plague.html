        <h3>About the study</h3>
        <p>
          It is the study the first chapter of <em>A Plague Tale: Innocence</em> titled <em>The DE RUNE Legacy</em>. The goal is to understand 
          the different <em>narrative processes</em> used during this level to showcase the story.
        </p>
        <p>
          The studied points are: the context of the game, the steps of the level, the narrative systems (cutscenes, camera, 
          dialogues, environment, etc.), the rhythm, the evolution of the characters, the game design, the level design and the 
          sound design.

        <h3>About the new level</h3>
        <h4>Title</h4>
        <p>Lost</p>
        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>
          The new level takes place right after Amicia wakes up in the castle, three days after Hugo had disappeared. The chapter ends before
           the ‘one month later’ indication of the chapter XV – Remembrance.
        </p>
        <h4>Pitch</h4>
        <p>
          Amicia and the orphans are looking actively for Hugo. Amicia cannot ignore what she saw during her hallucinations and wants to approach 
          the inquisition to know if they got her little brother. The group must avoid the dangers that surround the castle while going a bit 
          further each day.
        </p>
        <h4>How does it support the main story?</h4>
        <p>This chapter supports the story in three ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - The player can feel the time passing in the one-month period when Hugo is with the inquisition. It helps understand the loss that Amicia feels.
          </li>
          <li>
            - The player can feel the frustration and the desperation of a failure in the research. It will make him/her happier when he/she will find Hugo later.
          </li>
          <li>
            - It is a first try to get out of the castle to fight the inquisition and the rats. But as there are only Amicia and the orphans, they won’t 
            be strong enough. This introduces why Melie disagrees with going to the Cathedral to fight Vitalis firstly. As the castle is surrounded 
            by knights and rats, it also helps to feel the danger all around and can give more depth to the following scene, when Amicia and the 
            orphans secure the castle for the night.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>- Amicia and the orphans do research around the castle, in the forest.</li>
          <li>- They find some knights who are gathering ingredients for their alchemists and have built small camps.</li>
          <li>- They try to get close to the cathedral but the inquisition conducts a lot of business there and the area is too crowded. They step back.</li>
          <li>- Amicia and the orphans return to the castle to find other solutions.</li>
          <li>- They go to another side and find some ruins, when they enter, it is full of rats and they have to leave in a hurry. They are saved by the sun.</li>
          <li>- The following day Amicia wants to search further and walk the whole day with the orphans.</li>
          <li>- At sunset, rats are coming from holes in the grounds,Amicia and the orphans barely escape.</li>
          <li>- They go back to the castle and give up the research.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Characters involved</h4>
        <p>Amicia, Lucas, Melie, Arthur, Rodric, knights of the inquisition, rats.</p>
        <h4>Collectible</h4>
        <p>A new plant found in the ruins.</p>
