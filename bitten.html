          <p>Thomas turns at once to face his little brother, Olivier.</p>

              Olivier! You are alive! I can’t believe it, I’m so glad to see you! <br/>
              But … wait, what did you just say?
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Olivier is walking towards Thomas and stops next to him, looking at the bloody pool. He takes a deep breath.</p>
          <div class="dialogues">
            <h5>OLIVIER</h5>
            <p>I know you love blood… The smell of it, and its taste… I know what kind of killer you are, Thomas.</p>
            <h5>PLAYABLE CHARACTER</h5>
            <p>What the hell are you talking about? What happened to you? I don’t recognize you … you … you look so different!</p>
            <h5>OLIVIER</h5>
            <p>Me? I look different? Haha! I can’t believe I’m hearing this from someone like you!</p>
            <h5>PLAYABLE CHARACTER</h5>
            <p>What do you mean, someone like me?</p>
            <h5>OLIVIER</h5>
            <p>Oh! You think I don’t know who you are, werewolf?</p>
          </div>
          <p>Thomas looks surprised to learn his brother knows, and before he could answer, Olivier continues.</p>
          <div class="dialogues">
            <h5>OLIVIER</h5>
            <p>
              I know what kind of monster is hidden inside your very self. I know the beast you became… You, who never seemed to
               want a complicated life, always refusing any travel or change to your wife… But I should have known what you were 
               hidden from us, what you were hidden from me! All those years hiding yourself in the woods to kill innocent people!
